During a meeting with the onboarding team, I was introduced to the clock-in process and time tracking. To clock in, I was instructed to go to the Shifts tab, select the "WELCOME" channel, and click on the "CLOCK IN" option to initiate time tracking. Additionally, I learned about the importance of the 5Cs - collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, communication, and the 5Ws - who, why, what, where, when. These skills are essential for both personal and professional development. It was emphasized that having an attitude of problem-solving is crucial in finding solutions to one's own problems. 
i went through training manual, The training manual is an impressive and valuable resource that I highly recommend. One particularly noteworthy aspect is the SMILE method, which emphasizes the importance of taking ownership of your curiosity and actively engaging in exploration. On the contrary, I would suggest that you are accountable for your own happiness. This is because our accomplishments bring us joy, and prioritizing our own happiness is not a self-centered act.
