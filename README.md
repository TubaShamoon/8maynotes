Had a meeting with onboarding team, learned about clock in and tracking time(go to shifts, two channel appear select "WELCOME", there would be an option of 'CLOCK IN' click on it,your time tracking will start, learned about 5cs and 5ws and why they are so much essential for a professional and personal life, And having an attitude of finding the solution of your own problems is really important. 
Read the training manual, very impressive and useful content to consume, one best thing was the SMILE method, "you are responsible of your own curiosity and your own exploration" on the other hand i would say "you are responsible of your own happiness, bcz our achievements make us happy and it is never a selfishness to make yourself happy.
